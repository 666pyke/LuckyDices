## Features
- **Custom Dice Item**: Players can receive a unique dice item with a custom texture and lore, enhancing immersion.
- **Randomized Rewards**: Rolling the dice triggers a random reward from the configuration, providing variety and excitement.
- **Cooldown System**: A configurable cooldown ensures fair usage, preventing players from repeatedly rolling in a short period.
- **Inventory Management**: Checks for inventory space before giving the dice to players. If space is insufficient, the dice drops naturally nearby.
- **Visual Feedback**: Rolls display custom heads and sounds, with a unique 3D dice effect appearing in front of the player.
- **Configurable Commands and Permissions**: Admins can easily configure commands, messages, and permissions for smooth plugin operation.

## How It Works
- **Dice Item Commands**: Players can receive a dice item by using `/getdice`, and admins can distribute dice to other players with `/dice give [player] [amount]`.
- **Roll Mechanic**: Players right-click with the dice to roll, triggering a random reward based on the result. Each roll displays the dice outcome in 3D with custom sounds and effects.
- **Cooldowns and Inventory Checks**: Configurable cooldown messages inform players if they need to wait, and inventory checks ensure there is room for new dice.

## Commands
- **/getdice** - Gives the player a dice item.
- **/dice** - Main command for dice-related actions.
  - **/dice give [player] [amount]** - Gives a specified number of dice to a player.
  - **/dice reload** - Reloads the configuration.
